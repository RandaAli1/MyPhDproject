My Ph.D. project set out to investigate the effects of active retrotransposable elements on genome function and human health. There were three main objectives of the project:

1.	Curating a comprehensive database of known polymorphic RTE insertions using online databases and peer-reviewed studies.
2.	Investigating the genomic distribution of RTEs in comparison to the distribution of ancient subfamilies that are no longer capable of transposition.
3.	Investigating the occurrence of RTEs in risk loci associated with complex human traits and diseases, and identifying candidate RTE insertions that are potential variants of causation.
